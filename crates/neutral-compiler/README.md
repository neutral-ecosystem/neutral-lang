# neutral-compiler

`neutral-compiler` owns the captured-input compilation pipeline: private
frontend processing, semantic analysis, and lowering to public logical IR.

It depends on core, IR, and vocabulary contracts only. The CLI supplies any
host-facing capture work before this crate runs; `neutral-compiler` must remain
deterministic and free of filesystem, environment, network, command, locale,
and clock access. Its parser and semantic internals are intentionally private.
